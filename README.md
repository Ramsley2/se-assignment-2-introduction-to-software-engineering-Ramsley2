Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software Engineering is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software applications. Software Engineering involves various phases such as requirements analysis, design, testing and maintenance, which are structured and organized to ensure high quality software delivery.

Software Engineering differs from traditional programming in several ways:
Structured Approach: Software engineering involves a structured and organized approach to software development, whereas Traditional programming often focuses on writing code without a clear plan or process.
Documentation: Software engineering emphasizes documentation with detailed design documents and specifications used to guide the development process. Traditional programing often lacks this level of documentation.
Role of Software Engineers: Software engineers are responsible for leading teams of programmers, developing high-level plans, and ensuring software meets quality standards. On the other hand, programmers are focused on writing code to writing code to carry out these plans.
Skills Required: Software Engineers need a broad range of skills, including project management, computer science concepts, and experience with multiple programming languages. In contrast, programmers typically focus on coding skills and may not require the same level of project management or theoretical knowledge.
Overall Software Development: Software Engineering is concerned with the overall software development process (including requirements gathering, design, construction, testing, and maintenance). Traditional programming primarily focuses on writing code to meet specific requirements.
Methodology: Software Engineering uses structured methods (e.g., Agile, Waterfall), whereas Traditional programming may not.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured approach that defines the processes involved in the creation of software applications. It consists of the following phases:
a.	Requirement Analysis: Involves gathering and analyzing the requirements from stakeholders. There is then documenting of the functional and non-functional requirements.
b.	Planning: Estimating the resources, time, and cost required for the project. Creating a project plan and defining the project scope is also done.
c.	Design: Creating the software architecture and detailed designs for individual components and interfaces.
d.	Implementation (coding): Involves writing the actual code based on the design documents. Unit testing individual components as they are developed.
e.	Testing: Verifying and validating the software to ensure it meets the requirements. Different levels of testing conducted (unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing).
f.	Deployment: Releasing the software to the production environment. Ensuring the software is properly installed and configured.
g.	Maintenance: Providing ongoing support and updates to the software. Fixing bugs and implementing enhancements based on user feedback.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity refers to the practice of breaking up a software system into separate, interchangeable components called modules. These modules are designed to be relatively independent of each other, allowing for easier maintenance, testing, and reusability of code.
Modularity offers several benefits that improve maintainability and scalability of software systems:
Maintainability: 
a.	Isolation of changes: When changes or bug fixes are needed, they can be isolated within the relevant module without affecting the entire system. This makes it easier to identify and address issues without introducing unintended side effects.
b.	Code reusability: Modular components can be reused across different parts of the system or even in other projects, reducing duplication of code and development efforts.
c.	Easier debugging: With a modular design, it becomes easier to debug and diagnose issues because issues can be isolated within specific modules, making it easier to locate and fix bugs.
Scalability:
a.	Parallel development: Modularity allows different development teams to work on different modules concurrently, enabling parallel development and faster delivery of larger systems.
b.	Flexible system evolution: As requirements change or new features are needed, modular design makes it easier to add, modify, or replace individual modules without disrupting the entire system.
c.	Load balancing: In distributed systems, modular components can be deployed across multiple servers or nodes, allowing for better load balancing and scalability.


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Software testing involves verifying and validating that a software application is free of bugs, meets the technical requirements set by its design and development, and satisfies user requirements efficiently and effectively.
Levels of software testing:
a.	Unit Testing:
 Focuses on individual components or modules of the software. Verifies that each unit functions correctly and as expected. Ensures that the code is bug-free and meets the requirements.
b.	Integration Testing: 
Combines multiple units or modules to ensure they work together seamlessly. Verifies that the interactions between components are correct and that the software behaves as expected. Ensures that the software is stable and performs well under various conditions.
c.	System Testing:
Tests the entire software system, including all its components and interactions. Verifies that the software meets the functional and non-functional requirements.
d.	Acceptance Testing:
Tests the system’s readiness for deployment. Validates that the software meets user needs and business requirements.
